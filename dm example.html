<h3>Discrete Mathematics Examples</h3>
<b>Set Theory:</b> Set theory is defined as the study of sets which are a 
collection of objects arranged in a group. The set of numbers or objects can 
be denoted by the braces {} symbol. For example, the set of first 4 even numbers 
is {2,4,6,8}
<br><br><br>
<b>Graph Theory:</b> It is the study of the graph. The graph is a mathematical 
structure used to pair the relation between objects. Graphs are one of the prime 
objects of study in Discrete Mathematics.
<br><br>
<b>Logic:</b> Logic in Mathematics can be defined as the study of valid reasoning. 
There are three types of logic gates. They are AND(∧), NOT(~), and OR(∨)
<br><br>
<b>Permutation:</b> The different arrangements that can be made with a given number 
of sets taking some or all of them in a particular sequence at a time are called Permutation. 
For example, there are six permutations of the set {5,6,7}, namely (5,6,7), (5,7,6), (6,5,7), 
(6,7,5), (7,5,6), and (7,6,5).
<br><br>
<b>Combination:</b> The selection of a number of objects taking some or all of them at a time 
is called combination. The order of selection does not matter for the combination.
<br><br>
<b>Sequence:</b> According to some definite rules, a set of numbers arranged in a definite order
 is called a Sequence. A sequence is a function whose domain is the countable set of natural numbers.
<br><br>
<b>Series:</b> A series is the sum of the terms of a sequence. The result of adding all the terms 
together: s1+s2+s3+s4… is the sum of the series.
