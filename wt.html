    <h3>Web Technology</h3>
<p>Web Technology refers to the various tools and techniques that are utilized in 
    the process of communication between different types of devices over the internet. 
    A web browser is used to access web pages. Web browsers can be defined as programs 
    that display text, data, pictures, animation, and video on the Internet. Hyperlinked 
    resources on the World Wide Web can be accessed using software interfaces provided by 
    Web browsers.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In order to make websites look and function a certain way, web developers utilize 
    different languages. The three core languages that make up the World Wide Web are HTML,
     CSS, and JavaScript.
    In the IT world, the internet is an essential platform, whether it`s for developing or 
    for consumer use. When developing a website, typically three main languages come into play. 
    These languages are JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. HTML is the backbone of most webpages. 
    Essentially, it is used to create the structure of how a specific website would look like, 
    from the headings, to the paragraphs, the body, links, and even images.</p>
