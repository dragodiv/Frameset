<h3>What is Discrete Mathematics ?</h3>
<p>
Discrete mathematics is mathematics that deals with discrete objects. <br><br>
Discrete objects are those which are separated from (not connected to/distinct from) 
each other. Integers (aka whole numbers), rational numbers (ones that can be expressed 
as the quotient of two integers), automobiles, houses, people etc. are all discrete 
objects. On the other hand real numbers which include irrational as well as rational 
numbers are not discrete. As you know between any two different real numbers there is 
another real number different from either of them. So they are packed without any gaps 
and can not be separated from their immediate neighbors. In that sense they are not discrete. 
In this course we will be concerned with objects such as integers, propositions, sets, 
relations and functions, which are all discrete. We are going to learn concepts associated 
with them, their properties, and relationships among them among others.</p>
